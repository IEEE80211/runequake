Version 0.2.1  Tue Mar 12 21:33:50 EST 2002

    - Bug Fixes

        - Oops!  My recent changes to the environmental protection suit allowed
	  players to regenerate their health.  Since Rune_Enviro() uses .runetime,
	  this created problems for other rune types and would crash the server!
	  For now, I've disabled this feature.

Version 0.2  Tue Mar 05 15:44:01 EST 2002

    - Bug Fixes

        - Firing the lightning gun and super nail gun in safe water levels at
          certain angles will result in your ammo going straight ahead instead of
          following your player's angle.  This is fixed and should also correct the
          berserker rune/shaft oddity which caused the shaft to bob up and down.

    - Level Changes

        - I increased the default intensity for the "normal" lightstyle().
 
        - There are now two rocket launchers on E1M2; the original one has been
          replaced with red armor.

        - I added a grenade launcher and green armor to E2M4.

    - Sound Changes

        - I changed the sound heard when players first connect (shalrath/sight.wav).

        - Players in queue that enter the game will hear a loud popping
          sound (boss2/pop2.wav) to let them know they are in the game.

    - CVAR Changes

        - added scratch1 to control (see example.cfg)

            - lightstyle() intensity for all lights
            - turn off ambient_sound.
            - remove static light models

    - Notable Internal Changes

        - I'm using frikqcc to compile the distributions so you'll see a
          change in the Makefile.  You can download Frikqcc and a variety
          of other compilers at,

          ftp://ftp.runequake.com/quake/quakec/compilers/

        - I cleaned up most of the code in misc.qc; any light related function
          was moved to light.qc.

        - All unused (by me) test functions were placed in a new file called
          test.qc.

    - Other Changes

        - The environmental protection suit has all of the features that the
          rune has.

Version 0.1  Tue Jan 15 23:42:10 EST 2002

    - Initial release.
