        - There are now two rocket launchers on E1M2; the original one has been
          replaced with red armor.

    - Notable Internal Changes

        - I'm using frikqcc to compile the distributions so you'll see a
          change in the Makefile.  You can download Frikqcc and a variety
          of other compilers at,

          ftp://ftp.runequake.com/quake/quakec/compilers/

        - I cleaned up most of the code in misc.qc; any light related function
          was moved to light.qc.

        - All unused (by me) test functions were placed in a new file called
          test.qc.

    - Other
